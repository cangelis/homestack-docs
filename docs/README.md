# Introduction

Homestack is a docker based development environment which was designed to be yet easy but extensible. Its key features are

- Quick learning curve
- Extensible & customizable
- Running multiple versions of a software simultaneously
- Docker based
- Fully featured environment rather than a template
- Upgradable
- Portable

Let's see what all these mean...

## Learning curve

Getting started to homestack is pretty quick. You can simply build and up without any configuration needed and can extend it whenever you need.

## Extensibility

It is fully customizable but in a good way.. Homestack is not a template to develop your own environment, it is a fully featured environment itself. 
It is designed to be extensible which means you won't be breaking the core features while customizing it for your needs.

## Multiple versions simultaneously

Homestack's fundamental purpose is to run multiple versions of a software simultaneously. For example you'll be able to be running MySQL 8.0 and 5.7 at the same time so 
you'll be working on projects that have different needs.

## Docker based

It's docker based and pretty efficient! Don't pollute your machine. Destroy it when you break anything.

## Upgradable

You will be able to be upgrading it even if you customize it. It is a feature by design.

## Portable

It has been designed to keep your data files in the host operating system. So your data will not be in a blackbox like a virtual machine so you will be able to back up or move your data to
 another device and replicate the environment completely.

## I have no idea about Docker

No worries at all! Homestack is designed for everyone. So you don't have to know any bit of Docker. Just follow the documentation.
